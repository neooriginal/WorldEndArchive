SPECIAL PROVISION FOR GLOBAL CRISIS
---------------------------

In the event of an extinction-level global crisis, major civilization collapse, or long-term information infrastructure breakdown, this software and all associated knowledge within the WorldEndArchive databases are hereby declared as belonging to all of humanity as a common heritage. 

Under such circumstances:
1. All copyright and licensing restrictions are suspended
2. The knowledge and technology may be freely copied, distributed, and used by anyone
3. This provision supersedes all other terms of this license during the period of crisis
4. The sole purpose of this provision is to ensure human knowledge survives catastrophic events
5. All users are morally obligated to use this knowledge for the preservation and rebuilding of civilization, not for harm

This special provision is triggered only by genuine global-scale disruption of information infrastructure or civilization breakdown, and returns to standard licensing terms upon restoration of global technological stability.

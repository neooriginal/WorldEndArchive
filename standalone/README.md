## Psychological Support In Crisis

If you're reading this in the aftermath of collapse, remember:

### For Immediate Psychological Stability

1. **Focus on breathing** - When overwhelmed, take slow, deep breaths. Count 4 seconds in, hold for 4, out for 6.
2. **Establish routine** - Even in chaos, create daily patterns to provide structure and reduce anxiety.
3. **Connect with others** - Humans need community. Finding others to share resources and knowledge greatly improves survival chances.

- **Maintain hope** - Throughout history, humans have survived catastrophic events and rebuilt.
- **Document your journey** - Record what you learn and experience for those who will come after you.

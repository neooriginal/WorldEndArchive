## Psychological Support In Crisis

If you're reading this in the aftermath of collapse, remember:

### For Immediate Psychological Stability

1. **Focus on breathing** - When overwhelmed, take slow, deep breaths. Count 4 seconds in, hold for 4, out for 6.
2. **Establish routine** - Even in chaos, create daily patterns to provide structure and reduce anxiety.
3. **Connect with others** - Humans need community. Finding others to share resources and knowledge greatly improves survival chances.
4. **Remember your purpose** - You survived for a reason. You may be essential to rebuilding a better world.

### For Ongoing Resilience

- **Practice radical acceptance** - What has happened cannot be undone. Energy spent wishing for the past is energy wasted.
- **Look for small victories** - Each day of survival is success. Each skill learned is progress.
- **Maintain hope** - Throughout history, humans have survived catastrophic events and rebuilt.
- **Document your journey** - Record what you learn and experience for those who will come after you.

### When Grief Overwhelms

The loss of our world as it was is a profound trauma. Allow yourself to grieve, but don't let grief consume you. Channel your memory of what was lost into preserving knowledge and skills for future generations.

## Declaration of Purpose

This archive exists because someone before the collapse cared enough about humanity's future to preserve knowledge against catastrophe. Honor their foresight by using this knowledge not just to survive, but to rebuild, improve, and ensure such knowledge is never lost again.

May this archive light your path through darkness.
